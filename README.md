Replication package for the paper titled: The evolution of architectural decision making as a key focus area of software architecture research: A semi-systematic literature study

## Overview
In our getting-started-guide to architectural decision making, we have summarized 218 publications published over the last four decades.
For the literature review, we considered four digital libraries: ACM, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, and Springer Link. We have used the following search query for retrieving the publications: ("software architecture" OR "software design") AND ("decision making" OR "design decisions")

On executing the search query, we found 399, 144, 1,471, and 257 publications in ACM, ScienceDirect, Springer Link, and IEEE Xplore respectively. The resuling files are available in their respective folders with the suffix: _query_results.xlsx

In the second step, each publication was filtered by reading the title and abstract according to the inclusion criteria mentioned in the paper. This filtering step resulted in 97, 26, 71, and 182 publications from ACM, ScienceDirect, Springer Link, and IEEE Xplore respectively. The corresponding files are available with the suffix: _based_on_title_abstract.xlsx

The image below shows the end-to-end publication selection process and the final list of publications selected for our study is available in consilidated.xlsx file
